  "cbt.dialogue.intro.11.c": "Look uhh, I'm sorry I'm dragging you into this. I hope you can find it in your heart to help a fellow demon in need. I promise you will be rewarded greatly when this is over.",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.12.c": "Huh? Why are there supplies on the ledge?",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.13.c": "Gods damned Puritan Demon Hunters, those pests found this place. I should've known. You'll need to take care of them. Steal some of their supplies from that chest, and while holding a weapon jump down on them to perform a Pogo attack.",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.14.c.1": "Well, the supplies are all gone. Probably freshly burned if I had to wager.",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.14.c.2": "You'll need to find the ingredients yourself for the ritual to summon Pearl back. You can head out the back door to get started.",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.15.c.1": "Worry not about dying, I'll make sure you're brought back here before biting the dust.",
  "cbt.dialogue.intro.15.c.2": "Dialogue about meta progression.",
